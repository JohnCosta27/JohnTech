# Hi, I'm John

---

I am a Software Engineer, currently working at Decipad. I'm interested in various subjects including: Compilers, Linux Servers, Web Development, Distributed System and many more.

# Work

Currently working at [Decipad](https://www.decipad.com/) as a full stack engineer.

I worked in various project at my old university [Royal Holloway](https://www.royalholloway.ac.uk/), including a Wellness and Professional Development application, that allowed students to track their wellbeing and various professional skills.

Worked on a [InnovateUK](https://www.ukri.org/councils/innovate-uk/) funded project called Tensorcrypt, which allowed for zero-trust data analysis.

I am also a private GCSE/A-level Maths and Computer Science tutor, and have over 300 hours of tutoring experience.

# Interests

Outside of Computer Science, I play guitar (mostly metal), read and do Judo (currently a Red Belt). But I spent most of my time behind a screen, tinkering with software, or [ricing](https://excaliburzero.gitbooks.io/an-introduction-to-linux-ricing/content/ricing.html) my machine (again).

I like to take part in the [Advent Of Code](https://adventofcode.com/), and have various repo's for each years solutions.
